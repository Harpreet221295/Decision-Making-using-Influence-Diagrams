### Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Dysplasia(ARVD)
ARVD is a heart disease that is characterized by progressive replacement of cardiac muscle by
adipose (fat) cells and/or fibrosis (scar tissue), starting in the right ventricle. ARVD patients can
have potentially deadly arrhythmias (irregularities in the heart rate). There is a large heritable
component to the disease - up to half of cases are linked to a family history of the disease.
It is a progressive disease, and people with ARVD can remain asymptomatic for a long time
without suspecting that they have this condition. Currently, most patients with ARVD have
an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) surgically implanted. These devices are quite
effective in reducing arrhythmias.
